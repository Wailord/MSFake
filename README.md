MSFake
======

A simpler version of MSPaint built from the ground-up in C#. This was done as a school assignment in a GUI class and supports many features found in MSPaint. The assignment was to replicate MSPaint's drawing functionality, but most features are supported here regardless, including selection boxes and rotates/transforms.
